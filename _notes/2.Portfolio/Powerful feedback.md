Preparing feedback to be powerful, impactful, and positively received requires an investment of time and thought. Avoiding or lack of preparation can lead to “high stakes” conversations.

- You must prioritize feedback, which means intentionally setting aside time to give it.
- When things escalate: (1) Reflect on why you’re offering feedback, (2) Schedule time to meet, and (3) Get vulnerable
- There should not be a week in-between the event and the feedback. Consider: When is the earliest I can be thoughtfully in action?

### Get to know people

As a team, we are made up of unique individuals with different motivations, interests and needs. Make feedback and conversations more thoughtful and relevant by getting to know people on a deeper level.

- **Ask**: What drives them in their work? What motivates them? What are their goals? What are their personal values?
- Know your **superstars** from your **rock stars**, and how to support and provide feedback to both
- Put time aside to **prepare** for giving feedback to different types of people – What do you want the other person to understand? Do your goals align with their goals?![[스크린샷 2025-02-21 오후 3.04.55.png]]
